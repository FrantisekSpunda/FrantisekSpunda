# Hi new viewer 👋
Hi, my name is František Špunda and I live in Czech Republic. I work a lot in React, but I like to experience other FE frameworks. I also work on BE with Laravel. I've already met with a lot of frameworks on FE and BE, but im probably the most experienced in these. I love to develop my skills in programing, design, teamwork and other important things. I would probably spend my life just by studiing, but unfortunately love money too 😄. 

I also know C (and little bit in C++). I've worked with STM8 and ESP32. I like to play in C, because it's realy different from normal high-level languages, even its hard sometimes. The best thing a learned is to use ChatGPT for developing in C, because you can understand things that even school cant explain well.

Currently I work for Navmatix s.r.o, where I'm working in team on some React app. I'm also studiing IT on VUT in Brno.

| Subject | Skills |
| - | - |
| FE | Typescript❤️, React, Next.js, Tailwind❤️, Styled components😒, PWA, Sass and a lot of libraries |
| BE | Laravel❤️, Django, REST |
| Other | Git, Github, Azure, Gitlab, Jira, Trello, C, Makefile, etc. |

I can't name all libraries and languages, bcs I have memory like goldfish and I can't remember what I can actualy do🐱
