# Some info about me :D
Hi, my name is František Špunda. I live in Czech Republic. I am web developer. My experiences in FE is quite large, I am currently working on 2 big Next.js projects (see below). In backend I already met with MySQL, Laravel, Django, REST api etc. I love VS Code and git as my child I dont have (I'm 19 lol). Also some UI/UX design isn't problem for me.
