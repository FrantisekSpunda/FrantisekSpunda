# Hi 👋 😸
My name is František Špunda and I live in Czech Republic. I've worked a lot with Next.js and Laravel. I've met with other frameworks on FE and BE, but im probably the most experienced in these. I love to develope my skills and being creative.

I'm also skilled in C and C++. I've worked with microprocessors like STM8 and ESP32. I enjoy programing in C, because it's realy different from normal high-level languages, even its hard sometimes.

| Subject | Skills |
| - | - |
| FE | Typescript❤️, Next.js, Tailwind❤️, Alpine.js |
| BE | Laravel❤️, Django, PHP, REST api |
| Other | C, Github, Azure, Gitlab, Jira, Trello |

Can't name all libraries and languages, bcs I have memory like goldfish 🐟
