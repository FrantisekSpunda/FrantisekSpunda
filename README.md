# Hi 👋 😸
My name is František Špunda and I live in Czech Republic. I work a lot with Next.js, Laravel. I've already met with other frameworks on FE and BE, but im probably the most experienced in these. I love to develop my skills in programing, design, teamwork and other important things.

I also know C (and little bit in C++). I've worked with microprocessors like STM8 and ESP32. I enjoy programing in C, because it's realy different from normal high-level languages, even its hard sometimes.

| Subject | Skills |
| - | - |
| FE | Typescript❤️, Next.js, Tailwind❤️, Alpine.js |
| BE | Laravel❤️, Django, PHP, REST api |
| Other | C, Github, Azure, Gitlab, Jira, Trello |

Can't name all libraries and languages, bcs I have memory like goldfish 🐟
