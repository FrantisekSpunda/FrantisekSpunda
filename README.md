# Some info about me :D
Hi, my name is FrantiÅ¡ek Å punda. I live in Czech Republic. I'm interested in web development (coding and also programing). I have more experiences in frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass). In backend I already met with SQL, Django and REST api. I always work with git and gulp. Also some UI/UX design isn't problem for me. Javascript is my favourite.
