# About me and my experience
Hi, my name is FrantiÅ¡ek Å punda. I live in Czech Republic. I'm interested in web development (coding and also programing). I have little more experiences in frontend (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, VUE.JS). In backend I already met with PHP, SQL and currently I'm learning DJANGO. I always work with git and gulp. Also some UI/UX design isn't problem for me. Javascript is my favourite.
