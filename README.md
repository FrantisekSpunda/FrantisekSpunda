# Some info about me :D
Hi, my name is František Špunda. I live in Czech Republic. I am web developer. I prefer FrontEnd. My experiences in FE is quite large, I am currently working on 2 big Next.js projects (see below). In backend I already met with MySQL, PHP, Laravel, Django, REST api etc. I always work with git. Also some UI/UX design isn't problem for me. For Django projects, I'm using Heroku and AWS.
